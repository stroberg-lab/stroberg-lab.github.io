The inability to do so has been implicated in numerous protein folding diseases such as Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s and Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s disease, as well as diabetes and cancer.\n​The main regulatory mechanism by which cells control the ER environment is the unfolded protein response (UPR).

While the accuracy with which receptors can probe the concentration of ligands has been thoroughly investigated in dilute systems, the eect of macromolecular crowding on the inference of concentration remains unknown. In this work we develop a novel algorithm to simulate reversible reactions between reacting Brownian particles. This facilitates the calculation of reaction rates and correlation times for ligand-receptor systems in the presence of macromolecular crowding. Using this method, we show that it is possible for crowding to increase the accuracy of estimated ligand concentration based on receptor occupancy. In particular, we find that crowding can enhance the eective association rates between small ligands and receptors to a large enough degree to overcome the increased chance of rebinding due to caging by crowding molecules. For larger ligands, crowding decreases the accuracy of the receptor's estimate primarily by decreasing the microscopic association and dissociation rates. SIGNIFICANCE Developing an understanding of how cells eectively transmit signals within or between compartments under physical constraints is an important challenge for biophysics. This work investigates the eect that macromolecular crowding can have on the accuracy of a simple ligand-receptor signaling system. We show that the accuracy of an inferred ligand concentration based on the occupancy of the receptor can be enhanced by crowding under certain circumstances.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a collection of cellular feedback mechanisms that seek to maintain protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When the ER is “stressed”, either through high protein folding demand or undersupply of chaperones and foldases, stress sensing proteins in the ER membrane initiate the UPR. Recently, experiments have indicated that these signaling molecules detect stress by being both sequestered by free chaperones and activated by free unfolded proteins. However, it remains unclear what advantage this bidirectional sensor control offers stressed cells. Here, we show that combining positive regulation of sensor activity by unfolded proteins with negative regulation by chaperones allows the sensor to make a more informative measurement of ER stress. The increase in the information capacity of the combined sensing mechanism stems from stretching of the active range of the sensor, at the cost of increased uncertainty due to the integration of multiple signals. These results provide a possible rationale for the evolution of the observed stress sensing mechanism.","tags":["er stress,unfolded protein response,chemical sensing,mutual information,signal integration"],"title":"Information processing by endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Stress detection networks control protein homeostasis by mitigating the deleterious effects of protein accumulation, such as aggregation and misfolding, with precise modulation of chaperone production. Here, we develop a coarse model of the unfolded protein response in yeast, and use multi-objective optimization to determine which sensing and activation strategies optimally balance the trade-off between unfolded protein accumulation and chaperone production. By comparing a stress-sensing mechanism that responds directly to the level of unfolded protein in the ER to a mechanism that is negatively regulated by unbound chaperones, we show that chaperone-mediated sensors are more efficient than sensors that detect unfolded proteins directly. This results from the chaperone-mediated sensor having separate thresholds for activation and deactivation. Lastly, we demonstrate that a sensor responsive to both unfolded protein and unbound chaperone does not further optimize homeostatic control. Our results suggest a strategy for designing stress sensors and may explain why BiP-mitigated ER stress sensing networks have evolved.","tags":["biology,cell biology,chaperone (protein),endoplasmic reticulum,genetics,homeostasis,protein homeostasis,systems biology,unfolded protein response,wireless sensor network,yeast"],"title":"How to design an optimal sensor network for the unfolded protein response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

A switch from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge, ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX+E) mice; GnRH neurons are suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from OVX+E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential. Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron response in cells from OVX and OVX+E mice in the morning but not afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for estradiol- and time of day-dependent parameters was used to predict intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Infertility affects 15%-20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final common pathway for central neural control of ovulation. We studied how estradiol feedback regulates GnRH excitability, a key determinant of neural firing rate using laboratory and computational approaches. GnRH excitability is upregulated during positive feedback, perhaps driving increased neural firing rate at this time. Kisspeptin increased GnRH excitability and was essential for estradiol regulation of excitability. Modeling predicts that multiple combinations of changes to GnRH intrinsic conductances can produce the firing response in positive feedback, suggesting the brain has many ways to induce ovulation.","tags":["computational,estradiol,feedback,gnrh,kisspeptin,markov chain monte carlo"],"title":"Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neuron Excitability Is Regulated by Estradiol Feedback and Kisspeptin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

In this paper, we have identified four key steps in the NPmediated drug/gene delivery: (i) design and synthesis of delivery vehicle/platform; (ii) microcirculation of drug carriers (NPs) in the blood flow; (iii) adhesion of NPs to vessel wall during the microcirculation and (iv) endocytosis and exocytosis of NPs. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms behind these four key steps, we have developed a multiscale computational framework, by combining all-atomistic simulation, coarse-grained molecular dynamics and the immersed molecular electrokinetic finite element method (IMEFEM). The multiscale computational framework has been demonstrated to successfully capture the binding between nanodiamond, polyethylenimine and small inference RNA, margination of NP in the microcirculation, adhesion of NP to vessel wall under shear flow, as well as the receptor-mediated endocytosis of NPs. Moreover, the uncertainties in the microcirculation of NPs has also been quantified through IMEFEM with a Bayesian updating algorithm. The paper ends with a critical discussion of future opportunities and key challenges in the multiscale modeling of NPmediated drug/gene delivery. The present multiscale modeling framework can help us to optimize and design more efficient drug carriers in the future.","tags":["coarsegrained molecular dynamics,drug delivery,fluid-structure interaction,immersed molecular electrokinetic finite element,molecular mean-field theory,multiscale modeling"],"title":"Multiscale modeling and uncertainty quantification in nanoparticle-mediated drug/gene delivery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Because of the dominant importance of surface effects at the nanoscale, long-standing assumptions that are valid for macroscopic systems must be revisited when modeling nanoconfined fluids, because boundary conditions and the confined behavior of liquids are challenging to discern from experiments. To address this issue, here we present a novel coarse-grained model that combines parameters calibrated for water with a dissipative particle dynamics thermostat for the purpose of investigating hydrodynamics under confinement at scales exceeding current capabilities with all-atomistic simulations. Conditions pertaining to slip boundary conditions and confinement emerge naturally from particle interactions, with no need for assumptions a priori. The model is used to systematically investigate the imbibition dynamics of water into cylindrical nanopores of different diameters. Interestingly, we find that the dynamic contact angle depends on the size of the nanopore in a way that cannot be explained through a relationship between contact line velocity and dynamic contact angle, suggesting nonlocal effects of the flow field may be important. Additionally, a size-dependent characteristic time scale for imbibition is found, which could be useful for the interpretation of experiments and design of novel nanofluidic devices. We present the first systematic study that explains how contact angle dynamics and imbibition dynamics vary with nanopore radius. Our modeling approach lays the foundation for broader investigations on the dynamics of fluids in nanoporous materials in conjunction with experimental efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Hydrodynamics of capillary imbibition under nanoconfinement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Volcanic clasts, in contrast, are permeable and have irregular shapes. We performed a series of laboratory experiments to determine heat transfer coefficients for natural volcanic particles. We measured the surface and interior temperatures during cooling at wind speeds ranging from 0 to 10m/s. We also measured the permeability and density of the particles. We find that the permeability of the particles has little effect on clast cooling. In the absence of any wind, heat loss occurs by free convection, and we find no relationship between the heat transfer coefficient and particle density. However, for non-zero Reynolds numbers (finite wind speed), the heat transfer coefficient decreases with increasing porosity. We obtain a correlation for the dimensionless heat loss, or Nusselt number, of the form Nu=2+aRe1/2Pr1/3 where a is a density dependent coefficient given by a=0.00022??+0.31, with ?? in kg/m3, and Re and Pr are the Reynolds number and Prandtl number, respectively. Compared with non-porous particles, heat transfer coefficients for natural pumice clasts are reduced by a factor of 2-3 for particles with similar Re. Numerical simulations show that this leads to an increase in depositional temperature by 50-90??C. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.","tags":["heat transfer coefficients,permeability,pumice"],"title":"Heat transfer coefficients of natural volcanic clasts","type":"publication"}]
