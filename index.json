When the ER is 'stressed', either through high protein folding demand or undersupply of chaperones and foldases, stress sensing proteins in the ER membrane initiate the UPR. Recently, experiments have indicated that these signaling molecules detect stress by being both sequestered by free chaperones and activated by free unfolded proteins. However, it remains unclear what advantage this bidirectional sensor control offers stressed cells. Here, we show that combining positive regulation of sensor activity by unfolded proteins with negative regulation by chaperones allows the sensor to make a more informative measurement of ER stress. The increase in the information capacity of the combined sensing mechanism stems from stretching of the active range of the sensor, at the cost of increased uncertainty due to the integration of multiple signals. These results provide a possible rationale for the evolution of the observed stress sensing mechanism.","tags":[],"title":"Information processing by endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Eilertsen","W Stroberg","S Schnell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546671600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546671600,"objectID":"f5a7876e9e6b27b0a883ee17c82078dd","permalink":"https://stroberg-lab.github.io/publication/2019-eilertsen-jtb/","publishdate":"2019-01-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-eilertsen-jtb/","section":"publication","summary":"Scaling analysis exploiting timescale separation has been one of the most important techniques in the quantitative analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems in mathematical and theoretical biology. In the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions, it is often overlooked that the characteristic timescales used for the scaling the rate equations are not ideal for determining when concentrations and reaction rates reach their maximum values. In this work, we first illustrate this point by considering the classic example of the single-enzyme, single-substrate Michaelis–Menten reaction mechanism. We then extend this analysis to a more complicated reaction mechanism, the auxiliary enzyme reaction, in which a substrate is converted to product in two sequential enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In this case, depending on the ordering of the relevant timescales, several dynamic regimes can emerge. In addition to the characteristic timescales for these regimes, we derive matching timescales that determine (approximately) when the transitions from transient to quasi-steady-state kinetics occurs. The approach presented here is applicable to a wide range of singular perturbation problems in nonlinear dynamical systems.","tags":[],"title":"Characteristic, completion or matching timescales?

Usually, the kinetics of enzyme reactions is simplified with singular perturbation analysis to derive rate or time course expressions valid under the quasi-steady-state and reactant stationary state assumptions. In this paper, the dynamical behavior of coupled enzyme catalyzed reaction mechanisms is studied by analysis of the phase-plane. We analyze two types of time-dependent slow manifolds - Sisyphus and Laelaps manifolds - that occur in the asymptotically autonomous vector fields that arise from enzyme coupled reactions. Projection onto slow manifolds yields various reduced models, and we present a geometric interpretation of the slow/fast dynamics that occur in the phase-planes of these reactions.","tags":["Enzyme kinetics; Coupled enzyme assays; Michaelis-Menten reactions; Time-dependent slow manifold; Sisyphus manifold; Laelaps manifold; Differential-algebraic equation; Asymptotically autonomous vector field"],"title":"Phase-plane geometries in coupled enzyme assays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Eilertsen","W Stroberg","S Schnell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541052000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541052000,"objectID":"616470629f0ab1c90dbdc6cae170887f","permalink":"https://stroberg-lab.github.io/publication/2018-eilertsen-bpc/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-eilertsen-bpc/","section":"publication","summary":"A theoretical analysis is performed on the nonlinear ordinary differential equations that govern the dynamics of a reaction mechanism of zymogen activation.

The product of the first reaction is the enzyme of the indicator reaction, and both reactions are governed by the Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism. Using singular perturbation methods, we derive asymptotic solutions that are valid under the quasi-steady-state and reactant-stationary assumptions. In particular, we obtain closed form solutions that are analogous to the Schnell-Mendoza equation for Michaelis-Menten type reactions. These closed-form solutions approximate the evolution of the observable reaction and provide the mathematical link necessary to measure the enzyme activity of the non-observable reaction. Conditions for the validity of the asymptotic solutions are also derived, and we demonstrate that these asymptotic expressions are applicable under reactant-stationary kinetics.","tags":["Coupled enzyme assay; Time course experiments; Timescale separation analysis; Singular perturbation analysis; Schnell-Mendoza equation; Zymogen activation"],"title":"A theory of reactant-stationary kinetics for a mechanism of zymogen activation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W Stroberg","S Schnell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530597600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530597600,"objectID":"03dabd0216b6a7b29a39f9a33384993e","permalink":"https://stroberg-lab.github.io/publication/2018-stroberg-bpj/","publishdate":"2018-07-03T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-stroberg-bpj/","section":"publication","summary":"Cellular condensates-phase-separated concentrates of proteins and nucleic acids-provide organizational structure for biochemistry that is distinct from membrane-bound compartments.

A switch from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge, ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX + E) mice; GnRH neurons are suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from OVX + E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential. Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron response in cells from OVX and OVX + E mice in the morning but not afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for estradiol-and time of day-dependent parameters was used to predict intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.","tags":["computational; estradiol; feedback; GnRH; kisspeptin; Markov Chain Monte Carlo"],"title":"Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) neuron excitability is regulated by estradiol feedback and kisspeptin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W Stroberg","S Schnell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512630000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512630000,"objectID":"f9997a646cdb59480be560e9c5607013","permalink":"https://stroberg-lab.github.io/publication/2017-stroberg-jtb/","publishdate":"2017-12-07T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-stroberg-jtb/","section":"publication","summary":"The origin of cellular compartmentalization has long been viewed as paralleling the origin of life. Historically, membrane-bound organelles have been presented as the canonical examples of compartmentalization. However, recent interest in cellular compartments that lack encompassing membranes has forced biologists to reexamine the form and function of cellular organization. The intracellular environment is now known to be full of transient macromolecular structures that are essential to cellular function, especially in relation to RNA regulation. Here we discuss key findings regarding the physicochemical principles governing the formation and function of non-membrane-bound organelles. Particularly, we focus how the physiological function of non-membrane-bound organelles depends on their molecular structure. We also present a potential mechanism for the formation of non-membrane-bound organelles.

Here, a phase-plane analysis allows the derivation of a new condition for the validity of pseudo-first-order kinetics that is independent of the initial receptor concentration. The validity of the derived condition is analyzed from two viewpoints. In the first, time courses of the exact and approximate solutions to the ligand-receptor rate equations are compared when all rate constants are known. The second viewpoint assesses the validity through the error induced when the approximate equation is used to estimate kinetic constants from data. Although these two interpretations of validity are often assumed to coincide, we show that they are distinct, and that large errors are possible in estimated kinetic constants, even when the linearized and exact rate equations provide nearly identical solutions.

Detailed error analysis and numerical ``experiments″ show the required experimental conditions for the independent estimation of both $K_M$ and $V$ from progress curves. A timescale, $t_Q$, measuring the portion of the time course over which the progress curve exhibits substantial curvature provides a novel criterion for accurate estimation of $K_M$ and $V$ from a progress curve experiment. It is found that, if the initial substrate concentration is of the same order of magnitude as $K_M$, the estimated values of the $K_M$ and $V$ will correspond to their true values calculated from the microscopic rate constants of the corresponding mass-action system, only so long as the initial enzyme concentration is less than $K_M$.
