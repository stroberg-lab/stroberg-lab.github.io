      <title>Systems Biology of Proteostasis and the Unfolded Protein Response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1/3 of proteins in eukaryotic cells originate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The proper
folding of proteins within the ER requires the coordination of chaperones and foldases to guide nascent
proteins to the correct conformation. Should the folding environment within the ER be perturbed, the cell
must respond to restore proteostasis, or else risk accumulation of misfolded proteins. The inability to do
so has been implicated in numerous protein folding diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s and Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease,
as well as diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​The main regulatory mechanism by which cells control the ER environment is the unfolded protein response
(UPR). The UPR is a coordinated set of regulatory responses that originate from three signaling proteins
in the ER membrane, and seeks to mitigate unfolded protein &amp;ldquo;stress&amp;rdquo; by increasing the folding capacity of
the ER and decreasing translation. Should these interventions prove insufficient, the UPR initiates apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​I am interested in understanding how cells determine how stressed they are and how they coordinate a diverse
array of responses to mitigate that stress. The dynamic nature of the ER chemical environment, shape and
membrane composition makes stress signaling particularly complex. The response is equally complex, altering
the folding propensity, quality control, and export from the ER. To develop a theoretical understanding of
the protein secretory process across multiple scales, I employ techniques from control theory, signal processing
and information theory, chemical kinetics and molecular simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reactions in Crowded Cellular Compartments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Compartmentalization is the hallmark of eukaryotic life. While subcellular membrane-bound organelles have been
long formed the basis of cell biology, recently it has become clear that compartmentalization of proteins and
RNA also occurs transiently through liquid-liquid phase separation of the cytoplasm. The functional implications
of phase-separated macromolecular droplets are currently poorly understood. In many cases, droplets concentrate
enzymes, accelerating the processing of their substrates, while in other cases droplets sequester enzymes to
prevent their activity. In this project, we seek to develop theoretical understanding of how phase separation
and compartmentalization work in concert to adjust the rate of biochemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
